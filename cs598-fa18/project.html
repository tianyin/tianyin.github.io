    <h2>Reports and Code</h2>

    <p> <b>Submission:</b> Submit your reports and code to me via email.</p>

    <p> <b>Proposal:</b> Your project proposal should describe what you plan to
      do, why it is interesting, how you plan to do it, and what you are not
      sure about. Also describe what resources you think you will need to carry
      out the project (e.g., VMs, datasets).
      The end product of the proposal is a crisp <b>problem statement</b>.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #1:</b> Your checkpoint report should describe your progress
      on achieving the goals you included in your proposal.
      Clearly explain any changes you have made to the goal of your project
      based on your experience so far.
      Also, provide a concrete plan of what you will need to accomplish in the
      remaining weeks to complete your project.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #2:</b> Similar as Checkpoint #1.
      And what's more,
      you must include primary results (e.g., small-scale measurement results,
      examples that your prototype can already handle, etc).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final paper:</b> Your final paper should be written like a research
      paper you read in class.
      The report should be no longer than 6 pages.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Code:</b> You can host your code at GitHub or BitBucket, and send me
      the link.
      It is ok if you want to keep your code confidential,
      but please talk to me explicitly.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Paper/report format:</b> Please format you reports and papers with the
      <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates">new
        USENIX paper template</a> (2019 conferences).
    </p>

    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>

    <p>
      The projects could be (but not limited to) one of the following forms:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conduct an empirical study of a special type of reliability issues
          that occurred in real-world system deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a tool or a method that systematically uncovers reliability
          issues of existing software or system configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure certain reliability aspects of a special type of software or system configurations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    Here is a list of ideas to get you started thinking. Feel free to pursue your own ideas.
