    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this course is to teach the principles and practices of
        reliability engineering in modern "cloud-scale" systems, and expose the
        students to the research of software and system reliability.
        In this course, we will look at how large-scale systems fail in the
        real world, and we will study the state-of-the-art reliability
        techniques and practices, including those widely adopted in industry
        and new ideas proposed by academia.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be going over the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Availability</li>
            <li>Software defects</li>
            <li>Configuration and operation errors</li>
            <li>Network failures</li>
            <li>Observability</li>
            <li>Failure recovery</li>
            <li>Finding bugs</li>
            <li>Software engineering</li>
            <li>Testing production systems</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting</li>
            <li>Reliability auditing</li>
            <li>Formal verification</li>
            <li>Client-side reliability</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major course project.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    <p> The course does not have a textbook. Instead, the course material will
      come from seminal, noteworthy, or representative papers and articles from
      the literature. Each lecture (except the first) will have two assigned
      papers to read, typically including one from academia and the other
      from industry.
      You should read these papers <i>before</i> coming to class,
      and be prepared to discuss them. Occasionally I will also list
      recommended readings; you are encouraged to read those, but not required.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="readings.html">Reading list and schedule</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other students in
        the class — you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa.
        Often students form reading groups, which I heartily encourage.
        Note that group discussion, however, is not an effective substitute
        for actually reading the paper.
    </p>

    <h2>Class Participation</h2>

    <p>
        Since this is a discuss-based course, class participation is required.
        We will discuss the papers and articles that we will have all read
        before each class. I will lead discussions by asking questions of
        students at random in class. Note that your answers to these questions
        form a part of your overall grade,
        so it is important that you both show up to class as well as read the papers.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> What problem does the paper address?</li>
        <li> How is it different from previous work, if any?</li>
        <li> What is the approach used to solve the problem?</li>
        <li> How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?</li>
        <li> Was the paper, in your judgement, successful in addressing the problem?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. You will undertake your own research
        project individually or in a group of two to three.
        I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking (cf. the project page),
        but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas.
        You will write a project report and present it at the end of the course.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <p>
        You are expected to be aware of UIUC's
        <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html">academic
          integrity guidelines</a>. Any violation of the course or university policies
          will be treated very seriously, and could lead to severe repercussions.
          Don't cheat. It's not worth it.
